############# Simulator Inputs
# For a DNN benchmark, the simulator takes two files as input: 
# (1): a .json file containing the hardware specifications
# (2): a .json file containing the DNN specifications
# examples of the hardware .json file format are in genesys/SimDIT/Hardware_Json_Inference/ and genesys/SimDIT/Hardware_Json_Training/ directories
# examples of the DNN specifications .json file format are in genesys/SimDIT/DNN_Spec_Inference/ and genesys/SimDIT/DNN_Spec_Training/ directories

############# Simulator Outputs
# (1): a .csv file containing the layer-wise breakdown of the performance statistics of a benchmark DNN (automatically saved in the working directory upon simulation)
# (2): a .csv file containing the performance statistics for the full DNN benchmark
# the output results from simulation are saved in genesys/SimDIT/Results_Inference/ and genesys/SimDIT/Results_Training/ directories

# Performance statistics provided by the simulator (for training the statistics are for a single iteration):
# (i) #of accesses for all the on-chip buffers for all the datatypes (in KB)
# (ii) #of accesses for the off-chip DRAM for all the data types (in KB)
# (iii) #of various arithmatic operations
# (iv) #of compute cycles
# (v) #of stall cycles
# (vi) total cycle counts
